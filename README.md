This data set is a comprehensive collection of responses from a survey pertaining to mental health and underlying causes to its decline in the population, 
as well as general feelings on the modern world and the stressors that have surfaced with it. The survey was done on 10 individuals of varying age, gender, and 
education level. For anonymity purposes, names and other identifying information were not recorded in the data. 
For the purpose of clarifiaction, the tenth column, titled "favorite_modern_feature_3", is in fact a response to the question: what is your least favorite thing about
modern life? The assignment instructions mandated the column names, so I obliged, but it is an error nonetheless.
